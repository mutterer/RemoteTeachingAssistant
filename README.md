# History

 * v1.01 uses an image with text overlays instead of a text window; Thanks to @StillSciencing, adds a second line with command history. 
 * v1.02 Thanks to @psobolewskiPhD the Assistant window is removed from the the WindowManager and now reports tool and color changes by implementing IJEventlistener
